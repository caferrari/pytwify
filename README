This is a simple script to notify your twitter's friends timeline.
I have no plan to add support to post twitts or anything like that.

Installation guide:

- Download the pytwify to any location on your pc. Let's suppose you download it to your home folder: "/home/USERNAME/pytwify/"

- Create a file named ".pytwify.cfg" on your home folder with the following content:

[auth]
username = YOUR_TWITTER_USERNAME
password = YOUR_TWITTER_PASSWORD

[vars]
lastid = 0

- Create some kind of auto start for the script

- - I personaly use Ubuntu, so i have the "System / Preferences / Startup Programs" to do it, it runs the following command:
python /home/USERNAME/pytwify/pytwify.py

- - You can also use the ".profile" file on your home folder to start the pytwify, it's a script that runs when you log. If you want to use it, just append the following command in the ".profile" file:
python /home/USERNAME/pytwify/pytwify.py &

- Try to log out and in again. It should be working now =]
